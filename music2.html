                <p><i>Blonde</i> is the second studio album by Frank Ocean released on August 20th, 2016. This album appeared after a three year absence from pop culture. The word "blonde" has multiple meanings, both referring to Frank's younger years. The first intrepretation of blonde is that people typically have blonde hair when they are younger or that people with blonde hair are viewed as carefree and youthful. The name of the album sets the tone for the vibe of the album. </p>
                <p>In an interview with the New York Times, Frank discussed the album and when asked if he was "reaching for something ineffable", he responded with: "They’re just chords, just melodies. I don’t know what combination of those objects is gonna make me feel how I need to feel. But I know precisely the feeling that needs to happen." </p>
                <p>As one of my favorite albums of all time, I have probably listened to each track almost 100 times. Some of my favorite tracks on the album are "<a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4l9bFqgMaQ">Nights</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE005nZeF-A" target="_blank">Ivy</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlz_XHeUUis" target = "_blank">White Ferrari</a>" and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzS3WG6__G4" target="_blank">Pink + White</a>".</p>

                <p><i>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i> is the debut studio album by Billie Eilish released on March 29th, 2019. This album is about modern youth, drug addiction, mental health, and heartbreak. </p>
                <p>In an interview with Zane Lowe, Billie talked about how the album inspired by lucid dreaming and night terrors, crediting this feeling towards the title of the album stating that it "is basically supposed to be a bad dream, or a good dream".  </p>
                <p>I have been listening to Billie Eilish for a few years now, and I really enjoy her music. Her voice is very soothing and this album never fails to put me in my feels. Some of my favorite tracks on this album are "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZyybvVx-js" target = "_blank">Xanny</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaJx0Gj_LCY" target="_blank">Wish You Were Gay</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbMwTqkKSps" target="_blank">When The Party's Over</a>", and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4z1O3miesI" target="_blank">Listen Before I Go</a>".</p>

                <p><i>Ctrl</i> is the debut studio album by SZA released on June 9th, 2017. SZA collaborated on this album with many famous producers, eventually released one of my favorite R&B albums of all time. This album earned her four Grammy nominations, with a nomination for Best New Artist. </p>
                <p>This album is about SZA's personal experiences with modern love and desire, focusing on social media and low self-esteem. </p>
                <p>In an interview with TIME, SZA was asked about her plans for the future after <i>Ctrl</i>, and she responded "I want to learn the fine line between taking it seriously and taking it not too seriously. I think very great people take it seriously, but not too seriously. And I think I take it so seriously that I was like, I don’t even want to do this if I don’t excel. I didn’t even want to put my album out unless people really liked it. I wanted to quit because I was like, no one’s going to like this f-cking album. Now I just feel like, OK, I want to be here, I understand how to be here. Well, I don’t understand how to be here, but I understand how to tap into a portion of myself while I’m here. So I might as well tap into that source in myself until I don’t have anything else to tap, and then I’ll do something else."</p>
                <p>Some of my favorite songs on the album are "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHXfCOjb3fk" target="_blank">Love Galore</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTgUwtoLl_o" target="_blank">Garden (Say It Like Dat)</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp45V_M4Akw" target="_blank">Drew Barrymore</a>", and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tiixq9rT_J0" target="_blank">Supermodel</a>".

                <p><i>The Divine Feminine</i> is the fourth studio album by Mac Miller, released on September 16th, 2016. This album features many of my favorite singers, including Kendrick Lamar, Anderson Paak, Ty Dolla Sign, and Ariana Grande.</p>
                <p><i>The Divine Feminine</i> stands out to me as one of Mac's best albums, revealing a more sensitive and vulnerable side to himself. The album is a celebration of women and an exploration of the feelings that come with falling in love, heavily inspired by Mac's relationship with Ariana Grande.</p>
                <p>In an interview with Billboard, when asked about the concept behind the album and his thoughts on feminism, Miller responded, "I mean to me, women have always been the sturdiest people in my life and have been incredible sources of energy. I don’t know if I’m a feminist, but I just know that I am all for outspoken, powerful women. I’m blessed with them in my life. I don’t know if that makes me a feminist. A lot of this record is about the energy surrounding this planet. It’s a feminine one -- Mother Earth. We need to hold that up as something sacred."</p>
                <p>Some of my favorite songs on the album are "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR3GQfryp9M" target="_blank">Dang!</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WU7oGiwiao" target="_blank">Stay</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_iHakWos0" target="_blank">Skin</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fcsGS1dEro" target="_blank">Cinderella</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ADKdqcdNqs" target="_blank">Soulmate</a>", and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_8xCOSekog" target="_blank">My Favorite Part</a>". Mac Miller will forever be one of my favorite artists. </p>

                <p><i>Channel Orange</i> is the debut studio album by Frank Ocean, released on July 10th, 2012. After releasing his mixtape <i>Nostalgia, Ultra</i> in 2011, Frank Ocean became more well-known in the music industry, thus leading to the production and release of this album with Def Jam Recordings.</p>
                <p>Before the release of the album, Ocean spoke publicly about how orange reminded him of the summer he fell in love - setting the tone for the whole album. <i>Channel Orange</i> is one of my favorite albums, touching on themes of drug use and hopeless love. I have never come across an album like this. It is extremely unique and exists on its own plane.</p>
                <p>What I love most about Ocean's music is how personal and heartfelt you can tell each lyric is. There is so much beauty in each of his songs. I have probably listened to this album almost 100 times. Some of my favorite songs on this album are "<a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaLV003llhY" target="_blank">Pink Matter</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XCQNpjWmRE" target="_blank">Super Rich Kids</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JHu3b-pbh8" target="_blank">Thinkin Bout You</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMV31MWIjLE" target="_blank">Pyramids</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azgDZ-TBCzk" target="_blank">Pilot Jones</a>", "<a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3DWAJGaf7o" target="_blank">Lost</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMpypbtrcCg" target="_blank">Bad Religion</a>, and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFVlEft9uEs" target="_blank">Monks</a>".</p>

                <p><i>Flower Boy</i> is the fourth studio album by Tyler, the Creator, released on July 21st, 2017. This album features guest vocals from Frank Ocean, A$AP Rocky, Anna of the North, Lil Wayne, Kali Uchis, Steve Lacy, Estelle, Jaden Smith, and Rex Orange County.</p>
                <p>This album is all about self-discovery and growth, while Tyler uses driving as a metaphor for his journey through life. Tyler uses this metaphor to drive away from his problems, almost crash, and switch gears. </p>
                <p>This was probably the first album that Tyler showed true emotion in. In an interview where he discussed <i>Flower Boy</i>, Tyler said, "For ‘Cherry Bomb’ I purposely was like, I don’t want to get personal at all. Like, I’m just going to make songs. And in this one I was like alright, let me write down every feeling."</p>
                <p>I really enjoyed listening to this album, and love all of the tracks on it. I also think Tyler is an influential artist and I love his energy and attitude. Some of my favorite tracks on this album are "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZE62LpaqHg" target="_blank">See You Again</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wvhrRb3oU0" target="_blank">Pothole</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chy1oeTjgLA" target="_blank">Boredom</a>", and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNP8_xtq8YU" target="_blank">Glitter</a>". </p>

                <p><i>Swimming</i> is the fifth studio album released by Mac Miller on August 3rd, 2018. It was the last album that Miller released in his lifetime. This album was produced by Miller along with many other artist, including J. Cole (also one of my favorite artists).</p>
                <p>This album was released after Miller's very public breakup with musician Ariana Grande and after he was arrested for a drunken car crash. These two events inspired him to release this sad and wise album. Miller said that his car crash was one of the best things to ever happen to him - a true wake up call. He said, "You gotta understand: I lived a certain life for 10 years and faced almost no real consequences. I had no version of the story that didn’t end up with me being fine."</p>
                <p>Miller talks about the ups and downs of life in this album, and the self-acceptance that must come with it. He embraces the reality that he'll never have everything figured out. In contrast to <i>The Divine Feminine</i> which is a representation of Miller at the peak of his love life with Ariana Grande, this is a complex album that shows Miller juggling the many different emotions he was dealing with at the time.</p>
                <p>This was the first Mac Miller album that I listened to and it made me fall in love with his music and his voice. Some of my favorite songs on this album include "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4ocPPhtglU" target="_blank">Come Back To Earth</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGzhlLCdAVo" target="_blank">Hurt Feelings</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI-t1I_ppL8" target="_blank">What's The Use?</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsKT0s5J8ko" target="_blank">Self Care</a>", and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gzmFo8UiJQ" target="_blank">Ladders</a>".</p>

                <p><i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> is the fifth studio album released by Kanye West on November 22nd, 2010.</p> 
                <p>This album was an immediate success, and was named the album of the year by many well-known publications. It also won Best Rap Album at the 2012 Grammys.</p>
                <p>This album is all about the parts of West's life that he had to sacrifice for his immense fame. The album follows a narrative of the reality of his situation, a turning point leading into the fantasy life of fame and success and the love that comes with it, which is only to be interrupted by the reality of fame again.</p>
                <p>This is probably my favorite Kanye West album (even though he doesn't think so!). During an interview with SHOWStudio, Kanye said, "So many people rate Dark Fantasy as one of the best albums, and Yeezus and 808s are so much better and stronger." </p>

                <p>This album was inspired by Cole's favorite artists, such as Jay-Z, Kanye West, 2pac, and Eminem, taking little bits of their albums and applying them to his own. </p>
                <p>In an interview with Complex, Cole spoke about the album stating, "That’s exactly what it is. It’s crazy that I chose to record it in Hollywood because it’s such a “fuck Hollywood” album. Being out there maybe contributed to [me thinking], “I’m bugging. There’s some shit that’s way more important than how many albums I sell and if I’m the best.”</p>
                <p>This album is very calming and humbling, talking about everything Cole experienced before his rise to fame. This album was the start to a different side of Cole - not one that chases hit songs but rather spreads messages of love and harmony to its listeners.</p>
                <p>Some of my favorite tracks on the album include "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCGV26aj-mM" target="_blank">Wet Dreamz</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB7gyS1TsYo" target="_blank">A Tale of 2 Citiez</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHU6ZRQJ50Q" target="_blank">G.O.M.D.</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR6ybr-BQYY" target="_blank">No Role Modelz</a>", and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSXJkvQOLP0" target="_blank">Love Yourz</a>".</p>

                <p><i>Anti</i> is the eighth studio album by Rihanna, released on January 28th, 2016. This album strays away from Rihanna's previous dance/club music genre to a hip hop soul and R&B genre. This album is all about being anti-expectations and anti-establishment.</p>
                <p>In this album, Rihanna explores themes of toxic relationships, betrayal, libreation, and reconciliation. Rihanna also calls on her Barbadian roots in this album, with the cover art representing the crown of Neptune (calling on the trident on the Barbadian flag).</p>
                <p>In an interview with Vogue, Rihanna talked about the album and said "I didn’t really know what the sound of the album would be in the beginning. I knew what I wanted to feel. I didn’t quite know how I wanted to hear it, but I knew that I would know it when I felt it. And so I went through a host of songs—songs that I thought were big and songs that I thought were up-tempo and would make sense. In the end, I just gravitated toward the songs that were honest to where I’m at right now, and how I think. The things that I want to listen to. The things that I want to smoke to."</p>
                <p>I fell in love with this album when it was first released. Some of my favorite tracks on the album are "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49lY0HqqUVc" target="_blank">Kiss It Better</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL1UzIK-flA" target="_blank">Work</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7awq_VEdZzk" target="_blank">Desperado</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfN4PVaOU5Q" target="_blank">Needed Me</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RyInjfgNc4" target="_blank">Love on the Brain</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXZbmMfxKU4" target="_blank">Higher</a>", and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KpVE1fBnQs" target="_blank">Sex with Me</a>".</p>
